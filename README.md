# signalk-cloud
SignalK Node Server Plugin that updates and retrieves data from a SignalK cloud server

To use the signalk cloud server, first install this plugin via the Node Server App Store.

Now go to https://cloud.signalk.org/cloud/login and login via Google. You will be given a token which must be entered into the signalk-cloud plugin configuration.

Now all your boat data is available from anywhere in the world. 

With WilhelmSK, in Settings -> Connections, add a new Signal K Connection and point it to host cloud.signalk.org port 80. Go to Settings->Cloud and find your boat to view your data.

Combine it with the signalk-to-nmea2000 plugin and see other SignalK users via AIS display on your commercial MFD.
